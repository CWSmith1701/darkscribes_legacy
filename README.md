# Darkscribes/Lemontastica Legacy Database viewer 

This is a setup to allow those interested the ability to read the old Darkscribes and LEmontastica databases. It depends on Docker so you'll need that to keep going.

## Requirements

This project requires that you install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Users on MacOS and Linux will also need to install Docker-Compose as a seperate install. You will have to ensure all dependencies for Docker itself at installed as well. 

Two seperate sites wil be accessable through your web browser when the project is completed. 

Darkscribes.local and Lemontastica.local. Both Sites are legacy fanfiction archives.

Much of the Docker related portions of this project are based off this [artcile](https://blog.sylo.space/guide-to-install-nginx-php-mariadb-phpmyadmin-in-docker/) by [Harianto van Insulinde](https://blog.sylo.space/author/harianto/)
